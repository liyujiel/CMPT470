	<h1>My Exercise 2</h1>	

	<h2>Part 1: CSS implementations of my sketches</h2>

	<p>On Jan. 18th, I was assigned to redesign this <a href="http://www.oldbisbeeghosttour.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. Below are my final products.</p>
		
	<figure>
	<img id="init" width="400" src="./initial_sketch.jpg" alt="This is the png of the INITIAL sketch that you have submitted to Lisa."/>
	<figcaption>This is my sketch initially drawn on Jan 18th. The final <a href="liyujiel_layout.html" target="_blank">implementation</a> is not too different from the sketch, agreed?</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<figure>
	<img id="final" width="400" src="./sketch_of_final.jpg" alt="This is the png of the FINAL sketch that you have submitted to Lisa."/>
	<figcaption>This is our final sketch. The final <a href="liyujiel_final_layout.html" target="_blank">implementation</a> is not too different either, right?</figcaption>

	<h2>Part 2: Advanced feature</h2>	
	
	
	<!-- student, replace k with the actual number -->	
	
	<p>The <a href="extended.html" target="_blank">same webpage</a> with advanced CSS feature k.</p>
	
	<!-- student, add content for the quote tag below for Jay's convenience -->	
	<p>The tip for <code>k=7</code> is <q>Border Images</q>.</p>

	<h2>Part 3: Notes to Jay/Lisa about my implementations and modified design choices</h2>	
	
	<!-- student, note down things that would help us understand your work better; example items are provided below -->
	<ul>
	<li>I tried to link the weather section, but I don't have api access</li>
	<li>Advertisement section has same problem as I mentioned above</li>
	<li>I'm not sure we can use external layout framework such as bootstrap or not, if so, I can make it more pretty next time. :)</li>
	</ul>
